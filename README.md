# Project-1

In this project, I created two databases then imported the data from Excel into MySQL. I then altered the two tables with a new data_type column which stated "DS" for data science and "CB" for cyber data. I then merged the two tables together and filter by Great Britain.

The data was salary figures from the data science and cyber security industries.
